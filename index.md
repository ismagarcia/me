The focus of this study is to design and provide time- and space-efficient parallel data structures and algorithms for real-time rendering and general-purpose GPU applications. 

A large number of operations in computer graphics are concerned with the process of collecting spatial data in a computerâ€™s memory, in such a way that the information can be subsequently recovered as quickly as possible in order to be processed and generate a screen image in real-time. In this context, it is important to retain and organize the spatial data in such a way that fast retrieval and evaluation are possible.  

This thesis introduces three specific representations of spatial data with efficient parallel random-access for interactive rendering applications. Surface and volume representations of
different topology and sparsity are handled with efficient encoding and rendering algorithms, where the key idea is to create a mapping of the input data to a virtual grid, which naturally suits for parallel graphics processing units with a Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)
programming model.  

The proposed approaches create a coarse lattice in which each cell contains a local description of surface and volume information, required for rendering such regions of the domain. This low-bandwidth localized memory access pattern is increasingly advantageous in many-core architectures, were the usage of random-access parallel data structures is crucial to provide fast rendering speed and good visual quality.

#### Interactive Applications for Sketch-Based Editable Polycube Map

In this paper we propose a sketch-based editable polycube mapping method that, given a general mesh and a simple polycube that coarsely resembles the shape of the object, plus sketched features indicating relevant correspondences between the two, provides a uniform, regular and user-controllable quads-only mesh that can be used as a basis structure for subdivision. Large scale models with complex geometry and topology can be processed efficiently with simple, intuitive operations. We show that the simple, intuitive nature of the polycube map is a substantial advantage from the point of view of the interface by demonstrating a series of applications, including kit-basing, shape morphing, painting over the parameterization domain, and GPU-friendly tessellated subdivision displacement, where the user is also able to control the number of patches in the base mesh by the construction of the base polycube.

#### A Runtime Cache for Interactive Procedural Modeling

We present an efficient runtime cache to accelerate the display of procedurally displaced and textured implicit surfaces, exploiting spatio-temporal coherence between consecutive frames. We cache evaluations of implicit textures covering a conceptually infinite space. Rotating objects, zooming onto surfaces, and locally deforming shapes now requires minor cache updates per frame and benefits from mostly cached values, avoiding expensive re-evaluations. A novel parallel hashing scheme supports arbitrarily large data records and allows for an automated deletion policy: new information may evict information no longer required from the cache, resulting in an efficient usage. This sets our solution apart from previous caching techniques, which do not dynamically adapt to view changes and interactive shape modifications. We provide a thorough analysis on cache behavior for different procedural noise functions to displace implicit base shapes, during typical modeling operations.

Recent spatial hashing schemes hash millions of keys in parallel, compacting sparse spatial data in small hash tables while still allowing for fast access from the GPU. Unfortunately, available schemes suffer from two drawbacks: Multiple runs of the construction process are often required before success, and the random nature of the hash functions decreases access performance. We introduce a new parallel hashing scheme which reaches high load factor with a very low failure rate. In addition our scheme has the unique advantage to exploit coherence in the data and the access patterns for faster performance. Compared to existing approaches, it exhibits much greater locality of memory accesses and consistent execution paths within groups of threads. This is especially well suited to Computer Graphics applications, where spatial coherence is common. In absence of coherence our scheme performs similarly to previous methods, but does not suffer from construction failures. Our scheme is based on the Robin Hood scheme modified to quickly abort queries of keys that are not in the table, and to preserve coherence. We demonstrate our scheme on a variety of data sets. We analyze construction and access performance, as well as cache and threads behavior.

In this paper we propose an editable polycube mapping method that, given an arbitrary high-resolution polygonal mesh and a simple polycube representation plus optional sketched features indicating relevant correspondences between the two, provides a uniform, regular and artist-controllable quads-only mesh with a parameterized subdivision scheme. The method introduces a global parameterization, based on a divide and conquer strategy, which allows to create polycube-maps with a much smaller number of patches, and gives the user much more control over the quality of the induced subdivision surface. All this makes it a practical method for real-time rendering on modern hardware (e.g. OGL 4.1 and D3D11 tessellation hardware). By sketching these correspondence features, processing large-scale models with complex geometry and topology is now feasible. This is crucial for obtaining watertight displaced Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces and high-quality texturing on real-time applications.

Preserving details from a high resolution reference model onto lower resolution models is a complex, and sometimes daunting, task as manual intervention is required to correct texture misplacements. Inverse Geometric Textures (IGT) is a parameterization independent texturing technique that allows preservation of texture details from a high resolution reference model onto lower resolutions, generated with a given simplification method. IGT uses a parameterization defined on the reference model to generate an inversely parameterized texture that stores, for each texel, a list of all triangles that mapped onto it. This way, for any valid texture coordinate, IGT can know the point and the triangle of the detailed model that was projected, allowing application of details from the reference model onto the fragment from the low-resolution model. IGT is encoded in compact data structures and can be evaluated quickly. Furthermore, the high resolution model can have its own independent, secondary parameterization, so that no additional effort is required to directly use artist-designed content.

This paper presents a technique to render in real time complex trees using billboard clouds as an impostor simplification for the original polygonal tree, combined with a new texture-based representation for the foliage. The technique provides several new contributions with respect to previous approaches. The new algorithm allows progressive level of detail both at the geometric and at the shader levels. It also preserves the parallax effects of the original polygonal model keeping leaf positions, orientations, and preserving the overlapping of the leaves as seen from any view point. In addition, the texture-based representation provides high-definition close views without introducing high memory requeriments. We adapted a realistic lighting model with soft shadows and a global illumination precomputation, allowing to render highly complex scenes with thousands of trees in real time.

#### Tree rendering with billboard clouds

{% if site.phone_contact == "dummy_phone" %}

This paper presents a method to render complex trees on high frame rates while providing accurate occlusion and parallax effects. Based on the recognition that a planar billboard is accurate if the represented polygon is in its plane, we find a billboard for each of those groups of tree leaves that lie approximately in the same plane. The tree is thus represented by a set of billboards, called billboard cloud. The billboards are built automatically by a clustering algorithm. Unlike classical billboards, the billboards of a billboard cloud are not rotated when the camera moves, thus the expected occlusion and parallax effects are provided. On the other hand, this approach allows the replacement of a large number of leaves by a single semi-transparent quadrilateral, which considerably improvesnthe rendering performance. A billboard cloud well represents the tree from any direction and provides accurate depth values, thus the method is also good for shadow, obscurances, and indirect illumination computation. In order to provide high quality results even if the observer gets close to the tree, we also propose a novel approach to encode textures representing the billboards. This approach is called indirect texturing and generates very high resolution textures on the fly while requiring just moderate amount of texture memory.

On the other hand, clustering allows the replacement of a large number of leaves by a single semi-transparent quadrilateral, which improves rendering time considerably. Our impostors well represent the tree from any direction and provide accurate depth values, thus the method is also good for shadow computation.

This paper presents a simple method to render complex trees on high frame rates while maintaining parallax effects with impostor planes generated automatically by a clustering algorithm. Unlike billboards, these impostors are not rotated when the camera moves, thus the expected parallax effects are provided.
