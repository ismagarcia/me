## Industry advanced product development

<pre>
I'm a staff engineer at <a href="https://www.arm.com/">Arm</a> Machine Learning Group,
where I work on analysing neural networks for performance analysis 
and driving forward our new software and hardware IP with
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbratt" title="Ian Bratt">Ian Bratt</a> and David Mansell.

Between 2016-2017 I joined the <a href="https://www.arm.com/">Arm</a> Architecture and Technology Group, 
Inteligent Machines Future System Designs with <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/paulshughes">Paul Hughes</a>
analysing and prototyping models around subsystems with computer 
vision and ML

In 2012 I joined <a href="https://www.arm.com/">Arm</a> Processor Division working in system architecture 
and heterogeneous computing with <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/charles-garc%C3%ADa-tobin-0374071">Charles Garcia-Tobin</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-parker-1548aa1/">Jason Parker</a>.
</pre>

## Academic research
<pre>
My research concerned with parallel efficient data structures for data 
visualization, from level-of-detail to texture-based rendering methods, geometric 
modeling and ray-tracing. 
My work explored practical applications in a variety of areas in computer 
graphics, including real-time tree rendering, gpu-based data-structures 
for geometric and texturing level-of-detail, and more recently dynamic 
parallel data-structures for ray-tracing and general-purpose gpu applications.

I have a Ph. D. in Computer Science from the universties <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-parker-1548aa1">UPC</a> & <a href="https://www.udg.edu/en/?_ga=2.210128597.1782169398.1547342987-753952721.1547342987">UdG</a>

In 2011 I did doctorate research internship in <a href="http://alice.loria.fr">ALICE Project-Team</a>
(INRIA Nancy), under supervision of <a href="http://www.antexel.com/sylefeb/research">Dr. Sylvain Lefebrve</a>

In 2007 I started my Phd. in Computer Grahics joining the <a href="http://ggg.udg.edu/">GGG</a>
research group, advised by <a href="http://ima.udg.edu/~dagush/">Dr. Gustavo Patow</a>.

In 2005 I did an internship at the <a href="">Computer Graphics Research Group</a> 
of the Technical University of Budapest. 
My mentor was <a href="http://www.fsz.bme.hu/~szirmay/szirmay.html">Prof. Laszlo Szirmay-Kalos</a>.

I was introduced in the Computer Graphics area advisored 
by <a href="http://ima.udg.edu/~mateu/">Prof. Mateu Sbert</a>.
