## Industry advanced product development

<pre>
I'm a staff engineer in <a href="https://www.arm.com/">Arm</a>'s Machine Learning Group working
with David Mansell and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbratt" title="Ian Bratt">Ian Bratt</a>.

My current work involves analysing neural networks of future use-cases, 
identifying the most relevant operations and data patterns, 
capturing key insights with data science techniques to advance 
real-world performance future <a href="https://www.arm.com">Arm</a>'s new software and hardware 
solutions.

Between 2016-2017 I worked in <a href="https://www.arm.com/">Arm</a>'s Architecture and Technology 
Group, as member of the Intelligent Machines Future System Design 
team, working with <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/paulshughes">Paul Hughes</a> analysing and prototyping 
computer vision and ML subsystems for ADAS.

In 2012 I joined <a href="https://www.arm.com/">Arm</a>'s Processor Division working in system architecture 
and heterogeneous computing projects with <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/charles-garc%C3%ADa-tobin-0374071">Charles Garcia-Tobin</a> 
and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-parker-1548aa1/">Jason Parker</a>.

## Academic research
<pre>
I have a Ph. D. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.udg.edu/en/?_ga=2.210128597.1782169398.1547342987-753952721.1547342987">University of Girona</a>.

My research concerned with parallel efficient data structures for data 
visualization, geometric modeling, image-based data structures
and ray-tracing. 

My work explored practical applications in a variety of areas in computer 
graphics, including real-time tree rendering, GPU efficient 
data-structures for geometric and texturing, and more recently 
dynamic parallel data-structures for ray-tracing and general-purpose 
GPU applications.

In 2011 I did a doctorate research internship in <a href="http://alice.loria.fr">ALICE Project-Team</a>
(INRIA Nancy), collaborating with <a href="http://www.antexel.com/sylefeb/research">Dr. Sylvain Lefebrve</a>.

In 2007 I started my Phd. in Computer Graphics joining the 
<a href="http://ggg.udg.edu/">GGG research group</a>, under the supervision of <a href="http://ima.udg.edu/~dagush/">Dr. Gustavo Patow</a>.

In 2005 I did a research internship at Technical University of Budapest
<a href="">Computer Graphics Research Group</a> collaborating with 
<a href="http://www.fsz.bme.hu/~szirmay/szirmay.html">Prof. Laszlo Szirmay-Kalos</a>.

I was introduced in the Computer Graphics field advised 
by <a href="http://ima.udg.edu/~mateu/">Prof. Mateu Sbert</a>.

## Selected industry projects

### Automotive ADAS subsystems and use-cases

Modeling and prototyping 


### Exploring new AArch64 ISA extensions (SVE)

Prototyping and analysing the impact of new <a href="https://community.arm.com/tools/hpc/b/hpc/posts/technology-update-the-scalable-vector-extension-sve-for-the-armv8-a-architecture">SVE (Scalable Vector Extension)</a> instruction set in computer vision workloads.
Exploiting as much data-level parallelism as possible for new instructions vector lengths that scale from 128 to 2048 bits.

### GPU coherency and heterogeneous computing

Modelling, early protytiping low-level software, and analysing heterogeneous compute use-cases to explore <a href="https://community.arm.com/processors/b/blog/posts/exploring-how-cache-coherency-accelerates-heterogeneous-compute">Shared Virtual Memory (SVM)</a> features between different type of processors (CPU & GPU) enabling sharing data, as simply as passing a pointer, which massively simplifies the software, more power efficient and higher performance than software managed mechanism.
